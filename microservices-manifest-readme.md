# Microservices Application Manifest

## Overview

This document describes the structure and functionality of the microservices application manifest, which provides a comprehensive configuration for deploying, managing, and monitoring microservices with built-in resilience patterns such as circuit breakers.

The manifest is designed to:
- Define service dependencies and their health monitoring
- Configure communication triggers and routes
- Establish logging mechanisms
- Implement automated responses to circuit breaker events
- Configure circuit breaker behavior for enhanced fault tolerance

## Manifest Structure

The manifest uses YAML for configuration and includes the following main sections:

### Metadata

Basic information about the application:

```yaml
# Metadata
appName: my-microservice-app 
version: 1.0.0
```

### Dependencies

Defines all microservices that make up the application, including their container images and health check configurations:

```yaml
# Dependencies
dependencies:
  - name: service-a
    image: my-registry/service-a:latest
    healthcheck:
      http: /healthz
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
  - name: service-b
    image: my-registry/service-b:latest
    healthcheck:
      http: /healthz
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
```

Each dependency includes:
- `name`: Unique identifier for the service
- `image`: Container image location and tag
- `healthcheck`: Configuration for monitoring service health
  - `http`: Endpoint to probe for health status
  - `interval`: Frequency of health checks
  - `timeout`: Maximum time to wait for a health check response

### Triggers

Defines the entry points for the application:

```yaml
# Triggers
triggers:
  - type: http
    route: /api/v1/process
    method: POST
    target: service-a
```

Each trigger includes:
- `type`: The mechanism for invoking the service (HTTP, event, etc.)
- `route`: Path or pattern for the trigger
- `method`: HTTP method (for HTTP triggers)
- `target`: Service to receive the trigger

### Logs

Configures logging destinations and formats:

```yaml
# Logs
logs:
  - type: file
    path: /var/log/my-app.log
  - type: syslog
    server: syslog.example.com
```

Each log configuration includes:
- `type`: The logging mechanism (file, syslog, etc.)
- Additional parameters specific to the logging type

### Automations

Defines automated responses to specific events:

```yaml
# Automations
automations:
  - trigger: circuit-breaker-open
    action:
      - type: scale-down
        target: service-a
        replicas: 0
      - type: alert
        message: "Circuit breaker opened for service-a"
        channels:
          - email: oncall@example.com
          - slack: #alerts
  - trigger: circuit-breaker-closed
    action:
      - type: scale-up
        target: service-a
        replicas: 2
      - type: alert
        message: "Circuit breaker closed for service-a"
        channels:
          - email: oncall@example.com
          - slack: #alerts
```

Each automation includes:
- `trigger`: Event that initiates the automation
- `action`: List of actions to perform, which may include:
  - Scaling operations
  - Alerts to specified channels
  - Other remediation steps

### Circuit Breaker Configuration

Configures the circuit breaker behavior for services:

```yaml
# Circuit Breaker Configuration
circuitBreaker:
  - service: service-a
    failureThreshold: 5
    retryTimeout: 30s
    fallback:
      action:
        - type: respond
          status: 503
          body: "Service unavailable"
```

Each circuit breaker configuration includes:
- `service`: Target service for the circuit breaker
- `failureThreshold`: Number of failures before opening the circuit
- `retryTimeout`: Time to wait before attempting to close the circuit
- `fallback`: Actions to take when the circuit is open

## Circuit Breaker Implementation

The circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures by temporarily disabling calls to failing services. Our implementation offers:

### States Management
1. **Closed**: Normal operation, requests flow through
2. **Open**: Failure threshold exceeded, requests are blocked
3. **Half-Open**: After retry timeout, allows limited requests to test recovery

### Key Features

- **Failure Detection**: Monitors response times, exceptions, and error rates
- **Automatic Recovery**: Transitions from open to half-open state after the retry timeout
- **Fallback Responses**: Provides meaningful errors to clients when a service is unavailable
- **Metrics & Monitoring**: Tracks circuit breaker states for observability

## Example Usage

This example demonstrates a complete manifest for a simple two-service application with circuit breaker protection:

```yaml
# Metadata
appName: my-microservice-app 
version: 1.0.0

# Dependencies
dependencies:
  - name: service-a
    image: my-registry/service-a:latest
    healthcheck:
      http: /healthz
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
  - name: service-b
    image: my-registry/service-b:latest
    healthcheck:
      http: /healthz
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s

# Triggers
triggers:
  - type: http
    route: /api/v1/process
    method: POST
    target: service-a

# Logs
logs:
  - type: file
    path: /var/log/my-app.log
  - type: syslog
    server: syslog.example.com

# Automations
automations:
  - trigger: circuit-breaker-open
    action:
      - type: scale-down
        target: service-a
        replicas: 0
      - type: alert
        message: "Circuit breaker opened for service-a"
        channels:
          - email: oncall@example.com
          - slack: #alerts
  - trigger: circuit-breaker-closed
    action:
      - type: scale-up
        target: service-a
        replicas: 2
      - type: alert
        message: "Circuit breaker closed for service-a"
        channels:
          - email: oncall@example.com
          - slack: #alerts

# Circuit Breaker Configuration
circuitBreaker:
  - service: service-a
    failureThreshold: 5
    retryTimeout: 30s
    fallback:
      action:
        - type: respond
          status: 503
          body: "Service unavailable"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Health Checks**: Implement comprehensive health checks beyond simple availability
2. **Failure Thresholds**: Set appropriate thresholds based on service characteristics
3. **Retry Timeouts**: Configure reasonable retry timeouts to prevent rapid cycling
4. **Fallbacks**: Provide meaningful fallback responses to maintain user experience
5. **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive monitoring of circuit breaker states
6. **Partial Degradation**: Design services to partially degrade rather than completely fail

## Advanced Configuration

### Service Mesh Integration

The manifest can be extended to work with service mesh technologies like Istio or Linkerd:

```yaml
# Service Mesh Configuration
serviceMesh:
  type: istio
  configuration:
    timeout: 2s
    retries:
      attempts: 3
      perTryTimeout: 500ms
    circuitBreaking:
      maxConnections: 100
      maxPendingRequests: 100
      maxRequests: 100
      maxRetries: 3
```

### Distributed Tracing

Add distributed tracing configuration:

```yaml
# Tracing Configuration
tracing:
  provider: jaeger
  samplingRate: 0.1
  endpoint: http://jaeger-collector:14268/api/traces
```

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Frequent Circuit Breaking**: 
   - Check for connectivity issues between services
   - Verify that timeout values are appropriate
   - Ensure health check paths are correct

2. **Failed Recovery**:
   - Inspect logs for persistent errors
   - Verify that retry timeouts are sufficient
   - Check for resource constraints

3. **Missing Alerts**:
   - Confirm alert channel configurations
   - Verify that automation triggers are correctly defined
   - Check alert service connectivity

## Extending the Manifest

The manifest structure can be extended with additional sections for:

- Rate limiting
- API gateways
- Service discovery
- Authentication and authorization
- Caching strategies
- Resource limits and requests

## Conclusion

This microservices manifest provides a robust foundation for building resilient applications with circuit breaker patterns. By properly configuring dependencies, triggers, logging, automations, and circuit breaker behavior, you can create applications that gracefully handle failures and recover automatically.
