# Seamless Active-Active Amazon Connect Architecture

## Overview

This document details how our multi-region architecture enables true active-active operations with 50/50 traffic distribution between two Amazon Connect instances. Unlike traditional active-passive setups, this architecture allows both instances to simultaneously handle live contacts with complete interoperability, ensuring optimal resource utilization and seamless customer experiences.

## Active-Active Capabilities

### True 50/50 Traffic Distribution

Our architecture enables equal distribution of contact center traffic across two Amazon Connect instances in different AWS regions through:

- **Traffic Distribution Groups (TDGs)**: Configured for balanced 50/50 distribution during normal operations
- **Dynamic Load Balancing**: Real-time adjustment based on current conditions while maintaining even distribution
- **Intelligent Routing**: Geographic proximity-based routing that still achieves overall 50/50 balance
- **Configurable Distribution Ratios**: Ability to adjust distribution percentages during specific events or maintenance

### Seamless Cross-Instance Operations

The true power of this architecture lies in its ability to treat two separate Amazon Connect instances as a single logical contact center:

#### Unified Agent Experience

- Agents can log into either instance while maintaining consistent access to tools and data
- Agent states are synchronized across instances (available, on call, in after-call work, etc.)
- Skills and routing profiles are mirrored between instances
- Agents can be dynamically reassigned between instances based on demand

#### Unified Customer Experience

- Callers receive identical treatment regardless of which instance handles their contact
- Contact history is available to agents in both instances
- Consistent IVR experiences and routing logic
- Seamless transfer capabilities between agents on different instances

## Key Enabling Technologies

### Real-Time Data Synchronization

The foundation of our active-active architecture is robust real-time data synchronization:

#### Contact Data Synchronization
- **DynamoDB Global Tables**: Provides multi-region, active-active database replication
- **Data Types Synchronized**:
  - Customer profiles and contact history
  - Contact attributes and context
  - Queue metrics and statistics
  - Agent availability and states
  - Routing configurations

#### State Synchronization
- **Kinesis Streams**: Enable real-time event synchronization between instances
- **Lambda Functions**: Process events and update state across both environments
- **Event Types Synchronized**:
  - Agent login/logout events
  - Status changes (available, offline, on break)
  - Contact initiation and termination
  - Queue updates
  - Routing decisions

### Seamless Call Routing and Transfer

Our architecture enables advanced call handling across instances:

#### Cross-Instance Transfer Capabilities
- **Direct Agent Transfers**: Agents can transfer contacts to specific agents in the other instance
- **Queue Transfers**: Contacts can be placed in queues managed by the other instance
- **Context Preservation**: Customer information and interaction history are maintained during transfers

#### Unified Queue Management
- **Global Queue Visibility**: Agents and supervisors have visibility into all queues regardless of instance
- **Cross-Instance Queue Prioritization**: Routing can consider agents in both instances for optimal handling
- **Balanced Queue Distribution**: Prevents queue buildup in one instance while the other has capacity

### Network Infrastructure Support

The Google Cloud infrastructure provides the necessary connectivity for true active-active operations:

#### Low-Latency Connectivity
- **Google Cloud Interconnect**: Provides <10ms latency between AWS regions
- **Direct Connect Integration**: Ensures reliable, high-bandwidth connectivity
- **Optimized Routing**: Cloud Router with BGP ensures optimal path selection

#### Anthos Gateway Capabilities
- **Stateful Session Management**: Maintains call context across instances
- **Intelligent Traffic Management**: Routes traffic based on real-time conditions
- **Protocol-Aware Routing**: Understands and optimizes for contact center protocols

## Implementation Benefits

### Operational Flexibility

This active-active architecture provides unprecedented operational flexibility:

- **Regional Capacity Adjustment**: Easily shift traffic percentages between regions for maintenance or capacity management
- **Gradual Feature Rollout**: Test new features in one instance with a controlled percentage of traffic
- **A/B Testing**: Compare different contact flow designs or routing strategies across instances
- **Peak Load Handling**: Dynamically adjust regional distribution during expected peak periods

### Seamless Failover

Unlike traditional failover which can disrupt operations, this architecture enables non-disruptive recovery:

- **No In-Progress Call Disruption**: Existing calls continue unaffected during regional issues
- **Automatic Traffic Redirection**: New contacts are automatically routed to the healthy instance
- **Graceful Degradation**: System can operate at reduced capacity rather than complete failure
- **Rapid Recovery**: Traffic can be gradually reintroduced to recovered regions

### Resource Optimization

The active-active approach optimizes resource utilization across both environments:

- **Balanced Agent Utilization**: Prevents one group of agents from being overloaded while others are idle
- **Efficient Handling of Time Zone Variations**: Morning peak in one region can leverage capacity in another region
- **Skill-Based Cross-Region Routing**: Access specialized agent skills regardless of region
- **Dynamic Overflow Handling**: Automatically leverage available capacity in either region

## Monitoring and Management

### Unified Operational View

Our architecture provides comprehensive visibility across both instances:

- **Consolidated Dashboards**: Combined metrics from both instances for holistic views
- **Cross-Instance Reporting**: Unified reporting capabilities across the entire contact center
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Live visibility into operations across both instances
- **Alerting and Notification**: Centralized alerting for issues in either instance

### Management Controls

Administrative functions are centralized while maintaining instance separation:

- **Synchronized Configuration**: Changes to contact flows, queues, and routing logic are automatically synchronized
- **Region-Specific Overrides**: Ability to customize specific elements for regional requirements
- **Centralized User Management**: Agent accounts and permissions managed cohesively
- **Controlled Deployment Process**: Coordinated update process across both instances

## Conclusion

This active-active architecture transforms two separate Amazon Connect instances into a single, cohesive contact center operation with true 50/50 traffic distribution. By leveraging AWS services for data synchronization and Google Cloud for reliable connectivity, it achieves seamless call management, unified agent experiences, and exceptional operational flexibility.

The result is a contact center environment that maximizes resource utilization, eliminates single points of failure, and provides consistent customer experiencesâ€”regardless of which instance handles their interaction.
