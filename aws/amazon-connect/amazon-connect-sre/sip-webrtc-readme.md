```

## Architecture

The Comstice SIP Connector serves as a middleware component that handles protocol conversion between SIP and WebRTC. It includes the following key components:

### SIP Infrastructure Components

```mermaid

    subgraph "Comstice SIP Connector"
    A[SIP Session Border Controller] --> B[SIP Proxy]
    B --> C[Media Transcoder]
    C --> D[WebRTC Gateway]
    end
    
    E[Carrier SIP Trunk] --> A
    D <--> F[Amazon Connect WebRTC API]
```

- **SIP Session Border Controller (SBC)**: Manages SIP sessions, provides security, and handles NAT traversal
- **SIP Proxy**: Routes SIP signaling traffic between endpoints
- **Media Transcoder**: Converts media codecs between SIP and WebRTC requirements
- **WebRTC Gateway**: Handles WebRTC protocol conversion and integration with Amazon Connect

### Integration Flow

```

## Key Features

### SIP to WebRTC Conversion

The Comstice SIP Connector provides bidirectional protocol conversion:

- **Inbound Conversion**: Transforms incoming SIP calls into WebRTC format compatible with Amazon Connect
- **Outbound Conversion**: Converts outbound WebRTC traffic from Amazon Connect to SIP for traditional telephony endpoints
- **Signaling Translation**: Maps SIP signaling (INVITE, BYE, etc.) to WebRTC signaling
- **Media Transcoding**: Converts between SIP codecs (G.711, G.729) and WebRTC codecs (Opus)

### Direct SIP Trunk Termination

The Comstice SIP Connector can potentially bypass the need for an on-premises corporate SBC:

- **Built-in SBC Functionality**: Includes security, NAT traversal, and SIP normalization
- **Direct Carrier Integration**: Can terminate SIP trunks directly from carriers
- **Simplified Architecture**: Reduces hardware footprint and potential points of failure

#### Considerations for Bypassing Corporate SBC

```

- **Security Analysis**: Evaluate whether the Comstice SIP Connector provides equivalent security to your corporate SBC
- **Network Assessment**: Ensure direct connectivity is possible between carrier and Comstice SIP Connector
- **Functionality Mapping**: Verify all required corporate SBC functions are available in Comstice
- **Carrier Compatibility**: Confirm your carrier supports direct termination to the Comstice SIP Connector
