# Amazon Connect Global Data Replication

This README provides a comprehensive guide for implementing global data replication between two Amazon Connect instances in different AWS regions configured in Active-Active mode.

## Overview

This solution enables:
- Real-time data replication between two Amazon Connect instances
- Automatic failover capabilities
- Continuous operation during regional outages
- Consistent call routing and agent state management across regions

## Architecture

The implementation uses DynamoDB Global Tables as the primary replication mechanism, with Lambda functions to handle synchronization of Connect-specific data. Route 53 provides intelligent traffic routing between the instances.

## Prerequisites

- AWS account with appropriate permissions
- Two Amazon Connect instances in separate AWS regions
- AWS CLI configured with administrator access
- Basic understanding of Amazon Connect, DynamoDB, Lambda, and Route 53

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Identify Data for Replication

Categorize the data that needs replication:
- **Real-time Data**: Agent states, queue metrics, current calls
- **Call Routing Data**: Contact flows, queue configurations, routing profiles  
- **State Tables**: Contact attributes, call recordings metadata, agent sessions

### 2. Create DynamoDB Tables

Create corresponding tables in both regions for each data category.

### 3. Enable DynamoDB Global Tables

Configure global table replication to automatically sync data between regions.

### 4. Create Lambda Functions for Data Synchronization

Implement Lambda functions to handle data transformation and synchronization between Connect and DynamoDB.

### 5. Set Up Connect Event Streams

Configure Amazon Connect to stream events to Kinesis, which triggers Lambda functions for data processing.

### 6. Implement Active-Active Routing

Configure Route 53 with weighted routing policies to distribute traffic between instances.

### 7. Implement Health Checks

Create health check mechanisms to monitor Connect instance status and trigger failover if needed.

### 8. Configure Real-time Contact Data Replication

Implement specialized handling for real-time contact data to minimize latency.

### 9. Set Up Monitoring and Alerts

Create CloudWatch alarms and dashboards to monitor replication health and performance.

### 10. Test Failover and Replication

Validate the implementation with comprehensive testing of replication accuracy and failover functionality.

## Maintenance and Monitoring

- Review CloudWatch dashboards daily
- Set up alerts for replication delays or failures
- Perform monthly failover tests to ensure reliability
- Update Lambda functions when new Connect features are released

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Replication Lag**
   - Check CloudWatch metrics for DynamoDB ReplicationLatency
   - Verify Lambda function execution times
   - Consider increasing provisioned capacity for DynamoDB

2. **Failover Not Working**
   - Verify Route 53 health check configuration
   - Check Lambda permissions for Route 53 updates
   - Test DNS resolution from multiple locations

3. **Data Inconsistency**
   - Review Lambda error logs for processing failures
   - Check DynamoDB ConsumedWriteCapacityUnits for throttling
   - Verify Global Table configuration for all tables

## Security Considerations

- Encrypt data at rest using DynamoDB encryption
- Use IAM roles with least privilege principles
- Implement VPC endpoints for enhanced security
- Enable CloudTrail for auditing all replication activities

## Cost Optimization

- Use auto-scaling for DynamoDB tables based on traffic patterns
- Configure Lambda concurrency limits
- Monitor cross-region data transfer costs
- Consider reserved capacity for predictable workloads

## Best Practices

- Keep Lambda functions focused on single responsibilities
- Implement comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- Document all configuration decisions and regional differences
- Perform regular disaster recovery drills
